These are the codes to accompany my Independent Studies report titled:
“The neural basis of cross-modal numerosity perception: Stimuli generation and EEG pilot”

The description of what the codes do is in the report. The codes themselves contain descriptions of their functions too.

Run the intensive_radii_relation function which will generate the 4D relation matrix required to generate stimuli or visualise them. Do load the resultant .mat file into your workspace before executing any other script.

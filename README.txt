These are the codes to accompany my Independent Studies report titled:
“The neural basis of cross-modal numerosity perception: Stimuli generation and EEG pilot”
The report can be found at: https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3435323.v1

The description of what the codes do is in the report. The codes themselves contain descriptions of their functions too.

Run the intensive_radii_relation function which will generate the 4D relation matrix required to generate stimuli or visualise them. Do load the resultant .mat file into your workspace before executing any other script.

You can request the pre-generated ‘intensive_radii_func.mat’ (116MB) file by emailing me at sushrut.thorat94@gmail.com
